            It is strategically placed on the Ashtavinyak Mahamarg, a 4-lane state highway (near Pune-Nagar Highway) that simplifies the commute and reduces the traveling time owing to its seamless connectivity. It is thoughtfully located near Ranjangaon MIDC/Near Ranjangaon Mahaganapati Temple, between Ahmednagar and Nashik Phata, two locales that have an excellent scope of development soon.
